# Tutorial Intro

Let's start writing some user stories.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

## Departments

Departments are different parts of your business that will be using the user stories. For example, `developers` `sales` `design`

```typescript
const developers = new Department({ name: 'Developers' });
```

## Generating CRUD Stories

Using the information we have above we can almost automatically generate user stories, just one last piece, models!
